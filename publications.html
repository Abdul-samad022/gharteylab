				</h4>
				<p class="abstract" style="color: #000">
					Schistosomiasis, an endemic neglected tropical disease in areas with poor sanitation, causes physical and mental defects in both children and adults. Various strategies, especially drug administration for morbidity control, have been implemented to combat the disease in Ghana and globally. Despite these efforts, schistosomiasis remains prevalent in Ghana, negatively impacting children's academic performance, growth, and overall quality of life. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of schistosomiasis in school children at Esuekyir, a peri-urban community in Ghana. A cross-sectional study using simple random sampling technique to select participants and collect stool and urine samples from 246 school children in Esuekyir was adopted. Microscopy of urine and stool samples was performed involving urine sedimentation and stool formol-ether sedimentation techniques to analyse for parasite eggs …

				</h4>
				<p class="abstract" style="color: #000">
					The global call for malaria eradication rested on finding drugs that not only act against asexual but also sexual forms of the parasite. The drawbacks in disease control and prevention due to drug-resistant clones of the parasite piqued our interest in exploring for alternative antimalarial drugs from the mangrove resources.
					This study evaluates the stage-specific anti-malarial and cytotoxic activities of the fractions of crude alkaloidal extracts from Avicennia africana leaves.
					The crude and alkaloidal extracts (AAA and AAQ) from A. africana were fractionated using column chromatography and further analysed using GC-mass spectroscopy. The fractions were then tested for antimalarial activity against the trophozoites, schizonts, and gametocyte stages of chloroquine-sensitive strains of 3D7 P. falciparum using the SYBR Green 1 assay. The cytotoxic effects of the fractions were evaluated using the MTT-based assay.
					The fractions AAA1-AAA5 and AAQ1-AAQ5 produced promising trophozoitocidal activities with an IC 50 value range of 0.399–45.690 µg/mL, with the artesunate (ref drug) yielding 0.09 x10 3 µg/mL. The schizonticidal and gametocytocidal activities of selected fractions demonstrated high potency with IC 50s of 0.622–18.820 µg/mL against artesunate (ref drugs) with 1.800 x10-3 and 5.100 x10-3 µg/mL, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of fractions produced CC 50 that was higher than 100 µg/mL with negligible cytotoxicity on erythrocytes and SI that ranged from 2.189 to 280.899. The major compounds identified in fractions AAA1, AAQ1, and AAQ2 were 8-carbomoylquinoline, razoxane, and dexrazoxane …

				</h4>
				<p class="abstract" style="color: #000">
					Nosocomial infections have gradually become an emerging threat to the healthcare system over the past decades and have been attributed to poor decontamination of hospital articles and weak antibacterial stewardship policies. This study sought to investigate the effect of disinfection on the prevalence and resistance profile of bacterial contaminants on oxygen device accessories, and clinical surfaces at the emergency unit of a tertiary health facility in Ghana. The study employed a cross-sectional study design to evaluate the occurrence of bacteria on surfaces in a tertiary hospital. Luminal swabs of the oxygen device accessories and swabs from clinical surfaces used by healthcare providers were collected for isolation and identification of bacteria. The identified bacteria isolates were then tested for their susceptibility to antibacterial agents. Data from this study were analyzed using Excel …
