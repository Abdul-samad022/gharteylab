			<p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">At the Ghartey Lab in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Cape Coast, we are dedicated to groundbreaking research that addresses some of the most pressing challenges in global health. Our multidisciplinary focus on parasitology, molecular biology, and computational screening positions us at the forefront of parasite identification, disease management, and therapeutic discovery.</p>		
			<h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
			<p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">Our research at Ghartey Lab focuses on combating parasitic diseases caused by Leishmania and Schistosoma, which continue to affect millions worldwide, particularly in underserved regions. Through comprehensive parasitology studies, we aim to understand the life cycles, pathogenicity, and host interactions of these parasites to develop better diagnostic tools, treatment protocols, and strategies for disease elimination. In tandem, we employ advanced molecular biology techniques, such as PCR-based diagnostics, genotyping, and DNA sequencing, to enable precise identification of Leishmania, Schistosoma, and other parasitic pathogens, bridging the gap between basic science and real-world healthcare applications. Additionally, we harness computational tools to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic compounds, using in-silico approaches like molecular docking, virtual screening, and bioinformatics to predict novel antiparasitic agents that can disrupt parasite survival and proliferation. Through these combined efforts, we strive to advance understanding, improve treatments, and ultimately contribute to global disease control and elimination.</p>
			<h1>Collaboration and Opportunities</h1>
			<p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">We believe in the power of collaboration. The Ghartey Lab welcomes partnerships with fellow researchers, students, and institutions passionate about making strides in parasitology and biomedical sciences. If you're interested in joining our lab or collaborating on a project, please <a href="mailto:george.ghartey-kwansah@ucc.edu.gh">contact us</a> or visit our department at the University of Cape Coast.</p>
			<p style="padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">Together, we can advance science, improve health, and make a difference.</p>
