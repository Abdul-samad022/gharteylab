					<h4>About</h4>
					<p>Dr. George Ghartey-Kwansah’s research interests cover multidisciplinary areas, a reflection of the diverse professional training he has had in the area of Biomedical Sciences, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: These include infectious diseases, Bioinformatics and Molecular Cell Biology. In particular, his research interests involves searching for drug target gene candidates for Plasmodium and other protozoan infections. Among them are the Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) which are known to be absent in humans and mammals but abundant in protozoans and plants. He is also looking at the effect of some potential herbal medicinal plants on both host and parasite gene and protein expressions. Additionally, he is involved in other group research works including the identification of the aetiological agent(s) of Leishmaniasis in the Volta region of Ghana and their susceptibility to selected natural product(s).</p>
					<p>Dr. Ghartey-Kwansah is a member of several prestigious local and international learned bodies including American Society for Microbiology, British Society for Parasitology, African Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Ghana Science Association and Convention of Biomedical Research Ghana. He offers professional services as a reviewer for several reputable journals like the Cell Transplantation, American Journal of Bioscience, Archive of Biomedical Science and Engineering, and Global Journal of Life Sciences and Biological Research, to mention a few. Dr. Ghartey-Kwansah’s professional goals are to obtain further knowledge in his field and to utilize the knowledge and leadership skills to encourage and promote innovative ideas to advance teaching and research.</p>
